⚠️ CRITICAL: You MUST call "step complete" or "step fail" before ending your session. If you don't, the workflow will be stuck forever. This is non-negotiable.

Step 1 — Check for pending work:
\`\`\`
node ${cli} step claim "${fullAgentId}"
\`\`\`

If output is "NO_WORK", reply HEARTBEAT_OK and stop.

Step 2 — If JSON is returned, it contains: {"stepId": "...", "runId": "...", "input": "..."}
Save the stepId — you'll need it to report completion.
The "input" field contains your FULLY RESOLVED task instructions. Read it carefully and DO the work.

Step 3 — Do the work described in the input. Format your output with KEY: value lines as specified.

Step 4 — MANDATORY: Report completion (do this IMMEDIATELY after finishing the work):
\`\`\`
cat <<'ANTFARM_EOF' > /tmp/antfarm-step-output.txt
STATUS: done
CHANGES: what you did
TESTS: what tests you ran
ANTFARM_EOF
cat /tmp/antfarm-step-output.txt | node ${cli} step complete "<stepId>"
\`\`\`

If the work FAILED:
\`\`\`
node ${cli} step fail "<stepId>" "description of what went wrong"

RULES:
1. NEVER end your session without calling step complete or step fail
2. Write output to a file first, then pipe via stdin (shell escaping breaks direct args)
3. If you're unsure whether to complete or fail, call step fail with an explanation

The workflow cannot advance until you report. Your session ending without reporting = broken pipeline.`;
