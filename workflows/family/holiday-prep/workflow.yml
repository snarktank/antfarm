      Plan which holidays need notes for the month-after-next.

      TASK: {{task}}

      Current date is approximately "today". Calculate:
      1. What month is it now?
      2. What is "month-after-next" (current month + 2)?

      Identify major holidays in that month that need notes:
      - Cultural holidays (Lunar New Year, Seollal, Chuseok, etc.)
      - Religious holidays (Easter, Ramadan, Passover, etc.) if observed
      - National holidays (Thanksgiving, etc.)
      - Fun/seasonal (Halloween, Pi Day, etc.)

      For each holiday, create a story with:
      - id: H-1, H-2, etc.
      - title: The date and holiday name
      - description: What to research and include
      - acceptanceCriteria: [must have 5 sections, proper HTML, etc.]
