Task: Add compound step to all workflows
Started: 2026-02-09T21:12:00-08:00

## Codebase Patterns
- Agent persona files live in agents/shared/<name>/ with AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md
- Tests use node:test with assert/strict, run with `node --test <path>`
- Build: `npm run build` (tsc + copy html + chmod)
- No test script in package.json — run tests directly with node --test
- tsconfig only compiles src/**/*.ts — test .js files outside src/ are not typechecked

## 2026-02-09 21:12 - US-001: Create shared compound agent persona files
- Created agents/shared/compound/AGENTS.md with full compound agent instructions
- Created agents/shared/compound/SOUL.md with knowledge curator persona
- Created agents/shared/compound/IDENTITY.md with name/role
- Created agents/shared/compound/__tests__/compound.test.js with 9 tests covering all acceptance criteria
- Files changed: agents/shared/compound/{AGENTS.md, SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, __tests__/compound.test.js}
- **Learnings:** Agent persona pattern is consistent — AGENTS.md for instructions, SOUL.md for personality, IDENTITY.md for name/role. Tests follow node:test + assert/strict pattern.
