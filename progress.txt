Task: Add easter egg ant command to antfarm CLI
Started: 2026-02-11 05:47 ET

## Codebase Patterns
- CLI entry: `src/cli/cli.ts`, commands matched via `group` variable from `process.argv[2]`
- Dynamic imports used for command modules (e.g., `await import("./ant.js")`)
- Build: `npm run build` runs `tsc -p tsconfig.json` + copies HTML + chmod
- Tests: `node --test dist/<file>.test.js` (node:test + node:assert/strict)
- ESM with NodeNext module resolution, `.js` extensions in imports
- RTS dashboard source assets live in `src/server/rts.html` + `src/server/rts-sprites/`; `npm run build` must copy both into `dist/server/`
- Feature structure world styling should be derived from a centralized helper (status -> visual state -> CSS class), then consumed in `renderWorld()` class selection
- Server-side pure logic is best kept in standalone modules (e.g., `src/server/*.ts`) so tests can import them directly without pulling in dashboard runtime dependencies

## 2026-02-11 05:47 - US-001: Add ant easter egg module with ASCII art and quotes
- Created `src/cli/ant.ts` with `printAnt()` function, 10 quotes, ASCII ant art
- Created `src/cli/ant.test.ts` with 4 tests (art output, quote output, 8+ unique quotes, no-throw)
- Wired `ant` command into `src/cli/cli.ts` via dynamic import
- Files changed: `src/cli/ant.ts` (new), `src/cli/ant.test.ts` (new), `src/cli/cli.ts` (modified)
- **Learnings:** CLI uses simple if-chain for command routing, not a framework
---

## 2026-02-11 05:52 - US-002: Wire ant command into CLI and add tests
- Created `tests/ant.test.ts` with 3 CLI integration tests (ASCII art, quote output, hidden from help)
- Tests use child_process.execFileSync to run the actual CLI binary
- All acceptance criteria verified: CLI works, hidden from help, tests pass, build passes
- Files changed: `tests/ant.test.ts` (new)
- **Learnings:** Node 22 runs .ts files directly with type stripping; tests in `tests/` use this approach

## 2026-02-12 11:34 - US-001: Replace text-only cancel/delete controls with RTS sprite buttons
- Added RTS source page at `src/server/rts.html` and switched BUILD control buttons to icon-backed sprite buttons while preserving IDs/click wiring
- Added new sprite assets: `src/server/rts-sprites/cancel-button.svg` and `src/server/rts-sprites/delete-button.svg`
- Updated build pipeline to copy `src/server/rts.html` and all `src/server/rts-sprites/*` assets into `dist/server/`
- Added regression test `tests/rts-command-controls.test.ts` to validate sprite references, accessibility labels/titles, and src/dist asset presence
- Files changed: `package.json`, `src/server/rts.html`, `src/server/rts-sprites/cancel-button.svg`, `src/server/rts-sprites/delete-button.svg`, `tests/rts-command-controls.test.ts`, `dist/server/rts.html`, `dist/server/rts-sprites/*`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings:** RTS UI is distributed from `dist/server/rts.html` but should be maintained from `src/server/rts.html` and copied during build
---

## 2026-02-12 11:38 - US-002: Implement Escape-driven draft cancellation (not only placement cancel)
- Added `cancelActiveFeatureDraft()` to remove selected uncommitted feature drafts, clear selection, persist state, and restore idle Action Console content
- Updated Escape keyboard handling to cancel active feature draft flow and still cancel placement mode via `setPlacement(null)`
- Added regression coverage in `tests/rts-escape-draft-cancel.test.ts` for helper behavior and Escape wiring in both `src/server/rts.html` and built `dist/server/rts.html`
- Files changed: `src/server/rts.html`, `dist/server/rts.html`, `tests/rts-escape-draft-cancel.test.ts`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings:** Draft-only feature buildings are represented as `state.selected.type === 'building'` with `kind === 'feature'` and `committed === false`, so Escape draft-cancel must target that shape explicitly
---

## 2026-02-12 11:41 - US-003: Render draft and in-progress feature structures at half transparency
- Added centralized run-status -> feature visual-state mapping helpers (`featureStructureVisualState` + `featureStructureClassName`) and used them from `renderWorld()` class selection for feature structures
- Applied `.is-half-transparent` to draft and in-progress feature structures and `.is-failed` to failed structures while keeping done structures fully opaque
- Added regression coverage in `tests/rts-feature-transparency-status.test.ts` validating helper presence, state mapping rules, render wiring, and transparency CSS class in both `src/server/rts.html` and built `dist/server/rts.html`
- Files changed: `src/server/rts.html`, `dist/server/rts.html`, `tests/rts-feature-transparency-status.test.ts`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings:** Feature visual-state policy is now centralized and should be extended via status-set constants (non-terminal/success/failed) instead of adding ad-hoc class logic in rendering loops
---
## 2026-02-12 11:47 - US-004: Remove subagent assignment editing/auto-assign UI while keeping automatic assignments on launch
- Removed editable assignment rows and auto-assign button from Feature Draft Setup panel in `src/server/rts.html`
- Preserved automatic launch assignment derivation via new `deriveLaunchAssignments(slots, draft, agentPool)` helper with slot default and workflow pool fallbacks
- Kept post-launch read-only assigned-agent visibility through existing `renderAgentStatusList(deriveAssignedAgents(...))` console/status list
- Added regression test `tests/rts-assignment-ui-removal.test.ts` covering UI removal, automatic launch assignment derivation, and post-launch read-only assignment visibility in both `src/server/rts.html` and built `dist/server/rts.html`
- Files changed: `src/server/rts.html`, `tests/rts-assignment-ui-removal.test.ts`, `dist/server/rts.html`, `progress.txt`
- **Learnings:** For RTS dashboard changes, validate both source and built HTML because tests assert parity across `src/server/rts.html` and `dist/server/rts.html`.

## 2026-02-12 15:39 - US-001: Replace placeholder research-plan type with production classification
- Added production research planning utilities in `src/server/research-plan.ts` with only `feature|bug` plan types and no placeholder-only acceptance branch
- Re-exported research-plan APIs from `src/server/dashboard.ts` to keep dashboard-facing imports stable
- Added `tests/research-plan-classification.test.ts` covering prompt structure, placeholder evidence classification into production plan types, and success/failure classification behavior
- Files changed: `src/server/research-plan.ts` (new), `src/server/dashboard.ts` (modified), `tests/research-plan-classification.test.ts` (new), `progress.txt`
- **Learnings:** Keep prompt-generation acceptance criteria defaults production-oriented so evidence classification can evolve without introducing type-level placeholders.
